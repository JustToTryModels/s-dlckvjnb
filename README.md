## ❓ What is Employee Churn?

**Employee churn** (also known as employee turnover or attrition) refers to employees leaving an organization, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. High churn rates can significantly impact a company through:

- 💰 Increased recruitment and training costs
- 📉 Loss of institutional knowledge and productivity
- 👥 Decreased team morale and engagement

This project uses machine learning to predict which employees are likely to leave, enabling HR teams to intervene early and improve retention strategies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Objective

Predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various factors such as job satisfaction, workload, tenure, and performance metrics.

### Approach

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Imbalance Handling**: Class weighting + Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

- Train-Test Split: 90% training, 10% testing
- Stratified splitting to maintain class distribution
- Test set locked for final evaluation only

### 2. Imbalance Handling Strategy

- class_weight='balanced' in Random Forest
- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5)
- Focus on both majority and minority class performance

### 3. Feature Selection

- Method: MDI (Mean Decrease in Impurity)
- Iterative testing from 1 to 17 features
- Selection based on custom priority order:
  1. Class 1 (Left) Recall
  2. Class 0 (Stayed) Recall
  3. Class 1 Precision
  4. Class 0 Precision
  5. Fewer Features
  6. F1 Scores
  7. Balanced Accuracy

### 4. Model Selection Criteria

- Performance thresholds: Recall ≥ 0.9 for both classes
- Optimal feature count for interpretability

## 💡 Key Findings

### Summary

The organization is facing a dual crisis of **burnout and stagnation**, systematically losing its most valuable employees. While low satisfaction (median 0.41 for leavers) is the immediate trigger, the root causes are structural: unsustainable workloads, a near-total lack of career progression, and compensation that fails to reward high effort.

### The Core Predictors of Turnover

| Metric | Employees Who Stayed | Employees Who Left | Key Insight |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Median Satisfaction | 0.69 | 0.41 | Low satisfaction is the common denominator for all departures |
| Median Evaluation | 0.71 | 0.79 | We are systematically losing our highest-performing employees |
| Median Monthly Hours | 198 | 226 | Leavers are pushed significantly harder |
| Promoted (Last 5 Yrs) | 1.8% | 0.3% | Promotions are a powerful yet neglected retention tool |

### The Workload Crisis: A U-Shaped Curve of Risk

| Risk Group | Hours/Month | Projects | Attrition Rate | Core Driver |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Extreme Burnout | 280–300+ | 6–7 | 62% – 100% | Unsustainable overload; 7 projects = 100% turnover |
| The Safe Zone | 160–220 | 3–4 | 1% – 4% | Optimal balance with highest retention |
| Under-Utilized | <160 | 2 | 30% – 54% | Boredom, disengagement, and poor role fit |

### Career Stagnation and the Tenure Cliff

| Tenure (Years) | Attrition Rate | Observation |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2 | 1.1% | High initial retention |
| 3 | 17.9% | First major spike in departures |
| 5 | 45.6% | Peak attrition point; nearly half of this cohort leaves |
| 6+ | 0.0% | Extreme loyalty among those who survive the cliff |

**The Promotion Paradox:** While only 1.69% of the workforce has been promoted, these employees have an attrition rate of 3.9%, compared to 16.8% for unpromoted staff.

### Compensation and Departmental Risks

| Salary Level | Attrition Rate | Workload Pattern | Key Insight |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Low | 20.5% | More Hours: 223 vs. 197 | High performers are overworked and underpaid |
| Medium | 14.6% | More Hours: 229 vs. 199 | Moderate earners face similar burnout risks |
| High | 4.8% | Fewer Hours: 160 vs. 201 | Leavers are often under-utilized |

### Critical Flight Risk Profiles

| Cluster | Performance | Satisfaction | Workload | Primary Reason for Leaving |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
| The Burned Out | High (0.8–1.0) | Very Low (0.0–0.2) | Extreme Overtime | Exhaustion and lack of work-life balance |
| The Poached Stars | High (0.8–1.0) | High (0.8–1.0) | High Overtime | Better external offers and lack of career growth |
| The Mismatched | Low (0.2–0.4) | Low (0.2–0.4) | Under-Utilized | Poor role fit or deep disengagement |

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Cap Workloads Immediately (Stop Burnout)

- **The Rule:** No employee should be assigned more than 4 projects or work more than 220 hours/month
- **The Fix:** Flag anyone working >220 hours. Redistribute their work to under-utilized staff
- **Why:** 7 projects or 300+ hours guarantees 100% turnover

### 2. Fix the "Mid-Career" Promotion Gap

- **The Rule:** Implement a mandatory career review at the 3-year mark
- **The Fix:** Create a clear promotion path. With only 1.69% of staff promoted in 5 years, experienced staff are forced to leave to advance
- **Why:** Promoted employees have ~4% churn rate vs. ~17% for non-promoted

### 3. Pay High Performers Fairly

- **The Rule:** Stop underpaying your hardest workers
- **The Fix:** Audit Low and Medium salary brackets. Identify employees with High Evaluations (>0.8) and give them raises or bonuses
- **Why:** You are losing top talent because they work the most hours but get the lowest pay

### 4. Engage the Under-Utilized

- **The Rule:** Identify employees with <160 hours or only 2 projects
- **The Fix:** Assign them more work, upskill them, or manage them out
- **Why:** Boredom is driving nearly as much turnover as burnout

### 5. Target High-Risk Departments

- **The Focus:** HR, Accounting, and Sales (highest churn)
- **The Fix:** Conduct "Stay Interviews" in these specific departments to identify local stressors immediately
